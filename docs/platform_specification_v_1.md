# IndicGlyph AI and OCR Platform Specification (Powered by Taapset Technologies)
**Version:** 1.0  
**Owner:** [Satyasai Ray]  
**Date:** [22-10-2025]  

---

IndicGlyph AI and OCR is a full-stack, mobile-first platform for curating multilingual OCR datasets, powered by Taapset Technologies.
Admins upload and slice scanned pages; reviewers annotate text, translation, phonetics, and meaning.  
Data routes through multiple reviewers, gaining ‚Äúgold‚Äù or ‚Äúreviewed‚Äù status and feeding exportable training datasets.
